# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly

# normal string
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# this string has line breaks
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# prints days
puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
# prints months on new lines
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

# not sure about this one.... maybe the q gives us qotes
# ohh its a formatted, indented quote.
puts %q{
    There;s something going on here,
    With this weird quotes
    We'll be able to type as much as ew like.
    Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
