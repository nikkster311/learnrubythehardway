print "How old are you?"
age = gets.chomp
print "How tall are you? "
height = gets
puts "How much do you weight??   "
weight = gets.chomp

puts "So, you're #{age} old, #{height} tall, and #{weight} heavy."
print "Does this work? #{age + height + weight}"

# looks like print and puts are the same.....

# print allows the users answer to go on teh same line as the string!!
